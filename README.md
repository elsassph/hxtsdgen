# TypeScript Declaration Generator for Haxe/JS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nadako/hxtsdgen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nadako/hxtsdgen)

**STATUS: WIP usable with limitations, feedback welcome!**

This is a [TypeScript declaration file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html)
generator for the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) JavaScript output target.

What it does is generate a `.d.ts` file next to the `.js` file generated by Haxe compiler,
containing TypeScript declarations for classes and functions exposed from Haxe using the [`@:expose` metadata](http://haxe.org/manual/target-javascript-expose.html).

## Usage

Just add `-lib hxtsdgen` to compiler arguments and it'll do the rest.

### Supported Haxe features

Certain Haxe features are compiler abstractions and thus may not be possible to translate
to TypeScript.

- [x] Classes
- [x] Interfaces
- [x] [Anonymous Structure](https://haxe.org/manual/types-anonymous-structure.html) Typedefs
- [ ] Other uses of [typedefs](https://haxe.org/manual/type-system-typedef.html)
- [x] Properties (as `get_prop/set_prop`)
- [ ] Native properties (needs compiler support)
- [ ] Enums (needs compiler support)
- [x] [Abstract enums](https://haxe.org/manual/types-abstract-enum.html) (see limitations)
- [x] Abstract enums as concrete `.ts` enums (`-D hxtsdgen_enums_ts`)
- [ ] More general [abstracts](https://haxe.org/manual/types-abstract.html) (unlikely, excepted possibly for return values)

### Limitations

#### No automatic export

Currently all the types have to be explictly exposed; types used by functions won't be
automatically exported so everything must be currently annotated for export.

#### Abstract enums

`hxtsdgen` can generate TypeScript [const enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html), which are a pure compiler construction:

> Const enums can only use constant enum expressions and unlike regular enums they are completely removed during compilation. Const enum members are inlined at use sites.

However this comes with important limitations:

- Const enums in `.d.ts` MUST be inlined, which only `tsc` supports in regular compilation,
- This is NOT compatible with the `--transpileOnly` option (needed for hot-reload),
  or **Babel**'s built-in support for TypeScript: both ignore types when producing JS,
- To work around this limitation, using option `-D hxtsdgen_enums_ts`, hxtsdgen can generate
  an extra `.ts` file including the `const enum`s, which in turn can be forced to compile to a
  "regular enum" using the option `--preserveConstEnums`.

## Why?

To make using Haxe/JS modules from both JavaScript and TypeScript much easier, of course!
Just compile your Haxe library to a JS module and use it in TypeScript in a perfectly typed way.

## Howe does it look?

Check out these 3 awesome panes (left-to-right):

 * `Main.hx` (Haxe source code)
 * `main.d.ts` (generated TypeScript declarations)
 * `test.ts` (TypeScript source code that uses the declarations)
